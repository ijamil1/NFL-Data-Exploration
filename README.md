# NFL-Data-Exploration
This was a personal project. Topics I explored include determining arbitrage opportunities given sports betting moneylines, determining how big of an advantage playing at home really is, exploring how often teams trending upwards or downards continue to win or lose, seeing if traveling further on away games makes a big impact on outcomes, and attempting to use data to predict game outcomes. Data was taken from FiveThirtyEight and Pro Football Reference. I had to scrape from Pro Football Reference, and I used Selenium and Beautiful Soup to do this.
